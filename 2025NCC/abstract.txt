Effective verification and validation techniques for modern scientific machine
learning workflows are challenging to devise.  In this talk, we will present a
numerical analysis approach to verifiable scientific machine learning by
demonstrating that (1) multiple standard interpolation techniques have
informative error bounds that can be computed or estimated efficiently;  (2)
comparative performance among distinct interpolants can aid in validation
goals;  (3) deploying interpolation methods on latent spaces generated by deep
learning techniques enables some interpretability for black-box models.  We
then demonstrate our workflow for predicting lift-drag ratios from airfoil
images.
