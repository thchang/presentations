Leveraging interpolation models and error bounds for verifiable scientific machine learning

Effective verification and validation techniques for modern scientific machine
learning workflows are challenging to devise.  In this talk, we will present a
numerical analysis approach to verifiable scientific machine learning by
demonstrating that (1) multiple standard interpolation techniques have
informative error bounds that can be computed or estimated efficiently;  (2)
comparative performance among distinct interpolants can aid in validation
goals;  (3) deploying interpolation methods on latent spaces generated by deep
learning techniques enables some interpretability for black-box models.  We
then demonstrate our workflow by predicting lift-drag ratios from airfoil
images.  This presentation is based on an article with the same title, recently
published in the Journal of Computational Physics.
