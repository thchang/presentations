\frametitle{Challenges and Solver Settings}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
  Solve a small problem on an extremely limited budget:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item 3 variable, 2 objective problem
  \item Experiments take about 10 mins and we have limited supply of reagent materials
  \item About 50 experiments max
  \end{itemize}

  \medskip

  Solver settings:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item 15-pt Latin hypercube, Gaussian RBF surrogate, L-BFGS-B optimizer
  \item 3 scalarizations per batch, sorted by temp (to speedup reaction)
  \item evaluated batch on CFR, TFMC and TFE peaks recorded by NMR
  \end{itemize}
