In this talk, two distinct problems in data-driven computational science are
considered.  The first problem is the interpolation problem, where an unknown
response surface representing an underlying phenomenon is approximated by
finding a function that exactly matches available data.  To solve the
interpolation problem, a novel algorithm is described for computing only a
sparse subset of the elements in the Delaunay triangulation, as needed to
compute the Delaunay interpolant.  For high-dimensional data, this reduces the
time and space complexity of Delaunay interpolation from exponential time to
polynomial time.  The second problem is the multiobjective optimization
problem, where the tradeoff surface (called the Pareto front) between multiple
conflicting objectives must be approximated in order to identify designs that
balance real-world tradeoffs.  In order to solve multiobjective optimization
problems that are derived from computationally expensive blackbox functions,
such as engineering design optimization problems, several methodologies are
combined, including surrogate modeling, trust region methods, and adaptive
weighting.  The result is a numerical software package that finds approximately
Pareto optimal solutions that are evenly distributed across the Pareto front
for a minimal price in terms of cost function evaluations.  For each of the
above problems, both serial and parallel implementations are described.
